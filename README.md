# **LEAP IELTS Engagement Prototype**

## **Overview**

This project is a lightweight proof-of-concept built for the **LEAP Scholar Product Intern Assignment**.  
It demonstrates an engagement concept called **“10-Minute Sprint Coach + Confidence Ladder”**, designed to improve early-stage user engagement and momentum in IELTS preparation.

The goal of this prototype is not visual polish, but to showcase the **core product loop**:

> **Task → Reflection → Confidence Update → Motivation**

---

## **Problem Context**

IELTS aspirants often:

- Delay serious preparation until the exam is close  
- Feel overwhelmed by the syllabus  
- Do not see visible progress in early weeks  
- Have limited daily time (10–30 minutes)  

This leads to **inconsistent engagement** and weak **habit formation**.

## **Concept**

### **1. 10-Minute Sprint Coach**

- Each day, the user gets **one small, focused task** for a single skill:
  - Reading  
  - Writing  
  - Listening  
  - Speaking  
- The task is designed to be completed in **~10 minutes**.

### **2. Confidence Ladder**

- Each skill has a **5-step confidence scale**:  
  **Very Low → Low → Okay → Good → Confident**
- After completing a sprint, the user answers a simple reflection:  
  > *“Do you feel more confident than yesterday?”*
- Based on this, the confidence level for that skill is updated.
- Progress is shown as **confidence growth**, not just content completion.

## **What This Prototype Demonstrates**

- **Skill-wise** progress tracking  
- **Confidence** as a leading indicator of motivation  
- How **small, consistent actions** can build momentum
