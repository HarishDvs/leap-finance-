LEAP IELTS Engagement Prototype
Overview

This project is a lightweight proof-of-concept built for the LEAP Scholar Product Intern Assignment.
It demonstrates an engagement concept called “10-Minute Sprint Coach + Confidence Ladder”, designed to improve early-stage user engagement and momentum in IELTS preparation.

The goal of this prototype is not visual polish, but to showcase the core product loop:

Task → Reflection → Confidence Update → Motivation

Problem Context

IELTS aspirants often:

Delay serious preparation until the exam is close

Feel overwhelmed by the syllabus

Do not see visible progress in early weeks

Have limited daily time (10–30 minutes)

This leads to inconsistent engagement and weak habit formation.

Concept
1. 10-Minute Sprint Coach

Each day, the user gets one small, focused task for a single skill:

Reading

Writing

Listening

Speaking

The task is designed to be completed in ~10 minutes.

2. Confidence Ladder

Each skill has a 5-step confidence scale:
Very Low → Low → Okay → Good → Confident

After completing a sprint, the user answers a simple reflection:

“Do you feel more confident than yesterday?”

Based on this, the confidence level for that skill is updated.

Progress is shown as confidence growth, not just content completion.

What This Prototype Demonstrates

A simple daily engagement loop

Skill-wise progress tracking

Confidence as a leading indicator of motivation

How small, consistent actions can build momentum

Product thinking focused on behavior change, not just features

Tech Stack

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

LocalStorage (for simple state persistence)

No backend

Single-page application

How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/HarishDvs/leap-finance-


Open the project folder.

Open the main HTML file (for example, index.html) in your browser.

That’s it. No build steps or dependencies required.

Scope and Limitations

This is a concept prototype, not a production application.

UI is intentionally simple.

Data is stored locally in the browser.

The focus is on demonstrating the engagement loop and product idea, not full functionality.

Purpose

This project was created as part of a Product Intern assignment submission to demonstrate:

User-centric product thinking

Clear engagement mechanics

Simple, testable product hypotheses

The ability to translate product ideas into a working prototype
